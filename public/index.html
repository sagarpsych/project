					<b>Purpose of the Study:</b> The research is being conducted by Sagar S. Lad, MA/MS., CSP., at William James College in partial fulfillment of a doctoral degree in psychology. I am researching how an individual’s perceptions of day-to-day experiences that can impact everyday life. I am inviting you to participate in this research project because you have indicated that you are 18 years of age or older.

I encourage you to read this form carefully and ask any questions you may have if you decide to participate, you will be asked to indicate with “I agree” at the bottom of the page for studies conducted online).
					<br><br>
					<b>Procedures:</b> In this study you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, a cognitive task, and a brief survey that should take no more than 15-20 minutes of your time. You will asked to first fill out general demographic information, then take part of a cognitive task, which will ask you to click “YES” or “NO,” and lastly fill out a survey of your present metacognitive feelings. You can choose to skip any questions that you do not feel comfortable answering or discontinue the questionnaire, cognitive task, and survey at any time.
					<br><br>
					<b>Potential Risks and Discomforts:</b> The study involves no more risk than encountered in everyday life.
					<br>
					<b>Potential Benefits:</b> Although there are no direct benefits to you, we hope that in the future, other people might benefit from this study to better help understand individual’s perceptions of day-to-day experiences that can impact everyday life.
